Release Notes

Neural Network Based
System Identification Toolbox

Version 2.0

Department of Automation, Technical University of Denmark, January, 2000



This note contains important information on how the present toolbox is to be 
installed and the conditions under which it may be used. Please read it 
carefully before use.

The note should be sufficient for being able to make the essential portion of 
the toolbox functions work properly. However, to enhance performance a number of 
functions have been rewritten in C and in order to compile these, it is 
necessary to read the information about CMEX files found in the Matlab External 
Interface Guide as well as to have some familiarity with compiling C programs.


INSTALLING THE TOOLBOX
o       All toolbox functions are implemented as plain m-files, but to enhance
        performance CMEX duplicates have been written for some of the most
        important functions. In the MATLAB 4.2 version the Makefile contains 
        the commands necessary for compiling the C-routines. If one is running
        MATLAB 4.2 under HP-UX, it should be possible simply to write
        >> !make
        in the MATLAB command window to invoke the compiler. If one is working
        on another platform it will be necessary to modify the Makefile
        accordingly. It is strongly recommended that the compilation be
        optimized with respect to execution speed as much as the compiler
        permits. Under MATLAB5 it might be necessary to copy the file 
        mexopts.sh to the working directory and modify it appropriately. To
        compile the MEX files under MATLAB 5 just type
        >> makemex
        in the MATLAB command window.
 

USING THE TOOLBOX
o       The checks for incorrect functions calls are not very thorough and
        consequently MATLAB will often respond with quite incomprehensible error
        messages when a function is passed the wrong arguments. When calling a
        CMEX-function, it may even cause MATLAB to crash. Hence, when using the
        CMEX-functions it may be a good idea to make extra copies of the m-files
        they are replacing (do not just rename the m-files since they are still
        read by the "help" command). One can then start by calling the
        m-functions first to make sure the call is correct.

o       The functions have been optimized with respect to speed rather than
        memory usage. For large network architectures and/or large data sets,
        memory problems may thus occur. If one is running the student edition of
        MATLAB one will almost certainly run into problems due to the rather
        small maximum size of the matrices allowed.
